# Group Project Milestone 1: Abstract, Data and Group Members

## Abstract
In this project, we are going to use the dataset from kaggle. We want to use the dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nelgiriyewithana/apple-quality. The dataset includes details such as fruit ID, size, weight, sweetness, crunchiness, juiciness, ripeness, acidity, and quality. We want to use the data from the dataset to train a model that can predict the quality of apples based on the  size, weight, sweetness, crunchiness, juiciness, ripeness, and acidity of the fruits. We will try to train different models and build a best fit model to minimize the error.
