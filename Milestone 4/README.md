## Model
The second model is SVM with linear kernal

## Hyper-parameter tune: kernal type

## Fitting
Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score are consistently high on the test dataset (around 93%), indicating that the model performs well on unseen data.

We can see the training, and testing metrics perform good and similar to each other which show that our model is just right. No overfitting or underfitting happen.

## Next models to try
1. Naive Bayes: Naive Bayes is a good model for classication task, and we are trying to classify rice base on features, which is appropriate.

## Conclusion
The model currently perform well, with above 93% accuracy on testing data. The model's test accuracy is a bit better than the previous one, which show that SVM can perform better in this classification task. To improve, we will try to use Naive Bayes in our final model to try to make better metrics.
