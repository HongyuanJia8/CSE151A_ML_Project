## Pre-processing
We preprocess the data and build our first keras model using Sequential. 

## Fitting
Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score are consistently high on the test dataset (around 93%), indicating that the model performs well on unseen data.

Loss metrics show that the validation loss (with values ranging from about 0.20 to 0.24) is reasonably close to the training loss (which decreases to about 0.23 by the end of training), and the test loss is also low (0.1883).

We can see the training, validating, and testing metrics perform good and similar to each other which show that our model is just right. No overfitting or underfitting happen.
